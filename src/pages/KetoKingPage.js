                    This project took place during my final semester at University from July 2019 â€“ October 2019. It was a
                    final project as a student to showcase my skills that I had accumulated over the years throughout the
                    Interaction Design course at the University of Technology Sydney as well as learning myself along the
                    way. I was part of a small team of three, where I was responsible for leading the collaboration as well
                    as the research, design and implementing the features and overall user experience related to a native
                    iOS application for the purpose of facilitating a learning experience for users into the Keto-genic
                    diet.
